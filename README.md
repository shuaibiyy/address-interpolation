# Address Interpolation

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shuaibiyy/address-interpolation/master)

## Prerequisites

### Install Dependencies

    conda env create -f environment.yml

### Data Preparation

[streets.zip](./data/streets.zip) contains most of the streets in Berlin. It was generated by [Preparation.ipynb](./Preparation.ipynb) and zipped for convenience.

Unzip it:

	unzip streets.zip

The [Address Reference](./ARS.ipynb) and [Interpolation](./Interpolation.ipynb) notebooks work with the data in data/streets folder. Note that github didn't allow an upload of the entire zip file content due to size limit. I should store it on S3.

To generate a different city's street data from [Preparation.ipynb](./Preparation.ipynb), you'll need data from these sources:
* https://www.openstreetmap.org
* https://openaddresses.io
* Street projection data, which can be extracted from [pelias interpolation](https://github.com/pelias/interpolation) after setting up the address and road network databases described in its README.
